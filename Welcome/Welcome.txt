Welcome to the Milk Shop!!
We are a medium scale retail business located in Colombo. The Milk Shop was established in 1969 by our founder, Mrs Dulcy Alwis and our company has been run by our family for over three generations. The Milk Shop started as a home run business run by diary-maid and home makers and rapidly expanded to much greater heights. Back in the day, we were a business run entirely by women. Today, we are the foremost diary product provider in Colombo, and our legacy of over half a century makes us well trusted in our line of work.
We specialize in many delicacies made of pure milk from our herds in our farm in the high plains of our country. We produce variants of butter, cheese, ice cream, yogurt, condensed and dried milk and much more. We incorporate new technology with the ancient knowledge gifted to us from our founding members.
Our milk is processed in our own modern diary factory which was established under the Danish technology.Our churned butter is of the highest quality and we are especially proud of our original flavors of ice cream. We use our highest quality cream in these originally- crafted ice cream recipes. While we do provide classic flavours such as vanilla, Strawberry, Caramel, Buttered, we also specialize in new and unusual flavours such as Halva, Ice Cookies and Cream ice cream.
We offer a wide assortment of hand-made gourmet cheeses like Roquefort,Camembert,Emmental,Cheddar,Gouda and Taleggio.
We also offer a wholesale program to restaurants. We provide bulk cheese and industry level amounts of all our diary products. Most high end restaurants and food outlets in the city utilize our products for their diary needs.
We have several outlets in the various suburbs in Colombo, and we are looking to further expand our business in the future.
