Milk
Milk of good quality is a very bland food with a slightly sweet taste, very little odor, and a smooth, rich feel in the mouth. Because of its bland flavor, the presence of minute quantities of abnormal constituents frequently results in off-flavors. Dairy producers and processors have, of necessity, been so concerned with the control of off-flavors, that until recently little attention has been given lower temperatures than prevailed with can collection systems. Most people associate the palatability of milk with its 'richness'. It is generally assumed that milk fat is one of the most important constituents in contributing to the desirable flavor of milk.
Although there is a close correlation between the concentration of fat and solids- not-fat in milk as produced by the cow, little attention has been given to the contribution of the solids-not- fat constituents to its flavor.

Curd
You may recall “curds and whey” from your childhood, but there’s more to curd than old nursery rhymes.
Curd itself is made from curdled milk and combined with plant acids, which is in turn more acidic than other milk products like yogurt. Nutritionally speaking, curd is a good source of protein and calcium, while also providing potassium, magnesium, and vitamin A.
While curd can be incorporated into a balanced diet to get the nutrients you need for healthy hair, some people also apply curd directly to the scalp. This is done to treat scalp conditions like dandruff more directly, as well as to help soften and strengthen the cuticle.
Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way.

Fresh Curd - Rs 200/=
Sour Curd - Rs 100/=
Plain Curd - Rs 300/=
Curd Tart - Rs 150/=
Sweet Curd - Rs 200/=
Peanut Curd - Rs 250/=

Ice-Cream
Not just any frozen treat can be called ice cream. In fact, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has specific rules that define what can and can't be labeled "ice cream." To bear the "Meets USDA Ingredient Standard for Ice Cream" stamp, it has to contain at least 10 percent milk fat, and a minimum of six percent non-fat milk solids. A gallon has to weigh at least 4.5 pounds.
The range of milk fat (sometimes referred to as butter fat) used in ice cream can go from the minimum 10 percent to a maximum of about 16 percent. Most premium ice creams use 14 percent milk fat. Higher fat content leads to better, richer taste and a creamier texture. Ice cream makers don't go higher than 16 percent because it would be costly and very high in calories.
Colourings are usually added, in addition to stabilizers.

Ice Cookies and Cream - Rs 200/=
Halva Ice cream - Rs 100/=
Vanilla Ice cream - Rs 300/=
Strawberry Ice cream - Rs 150/=
Caramel Ice cream - Rs 200/=
Buttered Pecan - Rs 250/=

Cheese
When it comes to cheese, people often say they love it so much they can’t live without it — but hate that it can make you fat and causes heart disease.
The truth is that cheese is what you call a whole food. Whole foods are generally good for you, as long as you don’t eat too much of one thing.
In this article, we’ll give you all the information you need to make healthy choices about eating cheese.
Cheese is a great source of calcium, fat, and protein. It also contains high amounts of vitamins A and B-12, along with zinc, phosphorus, and riboflavin.
Cheese made from the milk of 100 percent grass-fed animals is the highest in nutrients and also contains omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin K-2.
According to several studies, cheese — and dairy products in general — could work to protect your teeth from cavities.

Roquefort Cheese - Rs 200/=
Camembert Cheese - Rs 100/=
Emmental Cheese - Rs 300/=
Cheddar Cheese - Rs 150/=
Gouda Cheese - Rs 200/=
Taleggio Cheese - Rs 250/=

Butter
Butter is a product made from the solid components in milk (fat and protein).
Although most often made from cow’s milk, butter can be made out of milk from sheep, goats, buffalo, or other mammals.
Butter usually consists of approximately 80 percent fat, 15 percent water, and five percent protein.
The small amount of protein in butter acts as an emulsifier allowing the water and fat to stay suspended in single-phase solution.
The unique mixture of fats on butter allows it to stay solid at room temperature and melt at approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
The natural color of butter ranges from white to pale yellow depending on the diet of the animal that produced the milk.
Commercial butters are usually colored yellow with annatto or carotene to fulfill consumers expectations of yellow butter.

Grass-fed Butter - Rs 200/=
Cultured Butter - Rs 100/=
European Butter - Rs 300/=
Clarified Butter - Rs 150/=
Clotted Butter - Rs 200/=
Irish Butter - Rs 250/=

Yogurt
Have you noticed that the yogurt section of most grocery stores has practically taken over the dairy aisle? It’s getting harder to find more traditional dairy foods, such as cottage cheese and sour cream, amid the sea of yogurt options. But it only makes sense that a food with as many health benefits as yogurt be given prime real estate in the supermarket.
And just what are the health benefits of yogurt?
First off, let us not forget that yogurt comes from milk. So yogurt eaters will get a dose of animal protein (about 9 grams per 6-ounce serving), plus several other nutrients found in dairy foods, like calcium, vitamin B-2, vitamin B-12, potassium, and magnesium.
But one of the words we're hearing more and more of regarding yogurt is "probiotics." Probiotics are "friendly bacteria" that are naturally present in the digestive system.

Strawberry Blend - Rs 200/=

Strawberry and Peach - Rs 300/=
