Milk
Milk is important as a food among animal and vegetarian foods that provides essential nutrients for our body.Fresh cow milk has its unique taste, smell and colour. They are caused by proteins, calcium, and salt dissolved in milk.

Curd
Curd is a dairy product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called curdling. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins to tangle into solid masses, or curds.</div></div></a>
